Arina Glazunova was enjoying an evening out in Tbilisi, Georgia, last Friday (September 27) when tragedy struck.

Arina, who hailed from Moscow, Russia, was being filmed by a pal miming the lyrics of a song.

The 24-year-old then took the phone off her friend and proceeded to film her singing Russian boyband Hunger Boys' hit tune, 'For The Last Time'.

The clip shows her singing out the line: "No, I'm not waiting for you, but know that I loved for the last time, for the last time."

Tragic clip shows woman's final moments before being swept into the open sea during storm

The search for the unnamed woman is still ongoing
Social media users are issuing stern warnings to beachgoers after a horrifying clip of a woman being swept out into the sea has gone viral.

The terrifying incident, thought to have occurred earlier this week, began when a 20-year-old woman and her boyfriend headed down to a beach in Sochi, Russia.

In a video, the pair could be seen wading through the frothy shallows together before holding hands and later embracing.
Unfortunately, it appears as if the couple picked a particularly brutal day for a beach stroll as the Black Sea began to crash down on the shore around them

The clip - seemingly captured by a bystander - saw the pair attempting to move away from the angry waves.

But while the man was able to escape, the woman was seemingly swept away into the water.

The woman surfaced again before another wave quickly crashed around her and she disappeared off the coast.

Realising that his girlfriend was in serious danger, the man ran along the beachfront, paced the shore and attempted to rescue her from the water.

According to reports, a search mission has been launched to save the woman but has so far been unsuccessful.

Taking to X, formerly known as Twitter, media personality Colin Rugg has since added some more information.
